# Hangman
In this assignment, I created a Hangman game. This version of Hangman used a command attached to the key being pressed on a keyboard. This key press was then compared to the word that was chosed out of a list of possible words. The word chosen was a random word in an array. The comparison then went through every letter of the word chosen and compared it to see if the guess letter was a letter in the word. The game ended when either the guesses ran out, or the word was guessed correctly. This was if all the correct letters were picked.
